# ISRO API

### Fetching the API

I used *Promise* to get the data and used *foreach()* to process all the data and used necessary **DOM** tags to display the data depending on the content. Some datas are list and some are cards.

## Home Page

I appended the datas to different files based on the title and appended all the datas to the home page.

## Styling

I used bootstrap and internal css for the styling and responsiveness for the pages
