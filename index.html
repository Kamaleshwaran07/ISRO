        <div>
            The <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/">Indian Space Research Organisation</a> is the national space
            agency of India. It operates as the primary research and
            development arm of the <strong>Department of Space
                (DoS)</strong>, which is directly overseen by the
            <strong>Prime Minister of India</strong> while the
            <strong>Chairman of ISRO</strong> also acts as the executive of
            DoS. ISRO is primarily responsible for performing tasks related
            to space-based operations, space exploration, international
            space cooperation and the development of related technologies.
            ISRO is one of the six government space agencies in the world
            that possesses full launch capabilities, can deploy
            <strong>cryogenic engines</strong>, can launch extraterrestrial
            missions and operate a large fleet of artificial satellites.
            ISRO is one of the four government space agencies to have <strong>soft
                landing (uncrewed) capabilities.</strong>

        <div>
            Indian Space Research Organisation was founded on <strong>August
                15<sup>th</sup>, 1969</strong> by <strong>Vikram
                Sarabhai</strong>. In 1954, the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) was
            established in the foothills of the Himalayas.The Rangpur Observatory was set up in 1957 at Osmania
            University, Hyderabad. Space research was further encouraged by the government of India. In 1957, the Soviet
            Union launched Sputnik 1 and opened up possibilities for the rest of the world to conduct a space launch.
            The <strong>Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR)</strong> was set up in 1962 by <strong>Prime Minister Jawaharlal
            Nehru</strong> on the suggestion of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.Initially there was no dedicated ministry for the space
            programme and all activities of INCOSPAR relating to space technology continued to function within the DAE.
            IOFS officers were drawn from the <strong>Indian Ordnance Factories</strong> to harness their knowledge of propellants and
            advanced light materials used to build rockets. <strong>H.G.S. Murthy</strong>, an IOFS officer, was appointed the first
            director of the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station,[20] where sounding rockets were fired, marking
            the start of upper atmospheric research in India. An indigenous series of sounding rockets named <strong>Rohini</strong> was
            subsequently developed and started undergoing launches from 1967 onwards. <strong>Waman Dattatreya Patwardhan</strong>,
            another IOFS officer, developed the propellant for the rockets.

            <div>
               <strong>Chandrayaan-3</strong> is the third mission in the Chandrayaan programme, a series of lunar-exploration missions developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The mission consists of a lunar lander named Vikram and a lunar rover named Pragyan, similar to those launched aboard Chandrayaan-2 in 2019. Chandrayaan-3 was launched from <strong>Satish Dhawan Space Centre</strong> on 14 July 2023. The spacecraft entered lunar orbit on 5 August, and the lander touched down near the lunar south pole on <em>23 August at 18:03</em>, making India the fourth country to successfully land on the Moon, and the first to do so near the lunar south pole as <em><strong>no country has been landed on the dark side of the moon.</strong></em>
